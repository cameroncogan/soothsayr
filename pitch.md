Thank you all for coming today, and welcome to Launch. My name is Cameron Cogan.
A bit about me: I have a degree in English literature. I've spent most of my
academic career focusing on critical thinking skills. What does a piece of art mean?
How do we reconcile a creator's intent and historical context with contemporary
appreciations of their work? The focus in such pursuits is a close study and
deconstruction of the text or work in question, parsing out the fundamentals,
looking for patterns. At Launch Academy, I've learned to turn that same critical
eye towards coding, another activity that requires attentive patience. Just like
the themes we can see in a work of art, coding offers many paths to a solution,
any of which could serve the intrepid developer. Just like with writing, you can
lose yourself in code, manipulating the particulars until things seem just right.

Now about my breakable toy: Like many Americans, you've probably cursed the fact that
you can't bring your bulky Tarot card deck out to the bars to dazzle strangers by
telling their fortune. Well with TAROT APP, your prospects are looking up. My app allows
you to tell a stranger's fortune from any device with a browser. Learning tarot isn't
in the cards, you say? Then let the app tell your own fortune FOR you. TAROT APP uses a Rails
back end in conjunction with React live updating and animations. Let the intuitive interface
guide you, while you remain mysterious.

When I worked on Figur8te, a site for lampooning historical figures, I found coding the back end
to be much easier than getting the styling of the app right. Having completed TAROT APP, I feel
very comfortable now with front-end design.

As much as I've learned about coding in the last four months, I realize how much more I have
to learn as a software engineer, and I find that prospect energizing. I'm looking for a company
where I can be challenged and grow, and I look forward to discussing that in greater detail
with those of you who are interested. Thank you so much for your time.
